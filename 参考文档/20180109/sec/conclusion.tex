\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we design \name, a dynamically verifiable SSE scheme, which can be applied to any SSE schemes with a three-party model and does not require modifications on them. By building authenticators and a proof index, \name provides efficient search result verification, while preventing data freshness attacks and data integrity attacks in SSE. The experimental results demonstrate that \name introduces acceptable overhead in verifying search results.
